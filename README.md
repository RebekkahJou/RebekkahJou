**About**
After a lifelong love affair with casual website design, I am delighted to be starting a career as a full stack JavaScript software engineer. I love the juncture of form and function in websites, when you see something come to life that does what you need it to do in an attractive, intuitively usable product. I am an avid learner, and taught myself HTML as a teen, which I used throughout my life and always hoped to develop further. During the pandemic, I had the opportunity to teach myself JavaScript, and was accepted into the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy, where in a few months' time, I have learned full stack development through solo projects, pair programming, and team collaboration, and undergone experiences such as code review. Teamwork was a major part of my previous career as an editor, from working one-on-one with content specialists to help them refine complex material into grade-appropriate education assessment questions, to working with a team of editors in proofing and laying out materials, to being part of a company-wide effort to produce high-quality assessments. Much as I learned multiple style guides and software systems for editing content in my previous career, I am excited to now be learning new tech libraries and languages as a software developer. My continued passion for learning makes me excited to see what new skills and technologies I will learn and incorporate into my work in the future.
